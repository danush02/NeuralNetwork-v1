# Neural Network from Scratch
## Description:
This is a simple project where I have written a code for single node of a neural network only using numpy. This is done to understand the working a neural network and how feedforward and backpropagation works. The code is written in python and the code is well commented for better understanding.

## Details:
- This is a simple perceptron model that can be used to classify the data.
- The weights and biases are initialized randomly.
- The activation function used is sigmoid.
- The loss function used is sum of squares error.
- This can be used for dataset with n features and 2 classes.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.6
- Numpy

## Future Works:
- Will be adding more layers to the neural network.
- Will be adding more activation functions.
- Will be adding more loss functions.
- Will be adding more optimizers.
- Will be adding more datasets to test the model.
